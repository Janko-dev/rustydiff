# rustydiff
`rustydiff` is an [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) (`autodiff`) implementation written in Rust for educational and recreational purposes. Recently, I did a reverse mode autodiff implementation in C, for which the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Janko-dev/autodiff). However, I was wondering whether I would run into issues doing the same implementation in Rust, as the implementation of directed acyclic graphs is considered somewhat difficult by the Rust community. That said, the resulting API is much cleaner than the C version. 

Currently, both `forward` and `reverse` mode autodiff are implemented on scalar `f32` values. In forward mode, the derivatives are calculated as the computations are performed. In reverse mode, the derivatices are calculated after all computations are perfomed. There is a backward pass through the computation graph, in which the gradients 'flow' from the roots, i.e., the results of the computation, to the leaves, i.e., the input variables.
